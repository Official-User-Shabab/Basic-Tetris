# Basic-Tetris
An extremely backbones basic CLI version of the game Tetris.

Note that this was made for Linux mainly, I'll try get one up for Windows if I can

## To run

1) Download .cpp file
2) Run the code below in a terminal in same directory as file
```
g++ tetris.cpp -o tetris
```
3) Then run this:
```
./tetris
```
